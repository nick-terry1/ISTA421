4. MoveNext() returns a bool whether or not theres a next value. It points to the next value to enumerate. 

5. Reset() is void and doesnt return anything. It just returns the pointer back the the first value. 

6. They are not type safe because they return an object instead of a specific type. You make it type safe by writing the <T> into the IEnumerable<T>. 

7. Recursive algorithms dont maintain state information between method calls. 

8. You define an enumerator by creating a class that implements the IEnumerable interface. 

9. An iterator is a block of code that yields an ordered sequence of values.
