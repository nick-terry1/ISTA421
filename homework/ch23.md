1. Multitasking allows someone to do two or more things at once therefore finishing all tasks sooner than doing them one at a time. 
It also improves response time by allowing other short functions to run while a long running task is running.

2. Moores law is that the density of transitors on an IC will double every two years. It means that you can fit more processors onto a single 
chip and therefore you can run more than one program at the same time. 

3. The namespace is System.Threading.Tasks 

4. The difference is that tasks is the action being completed and the thread is the unit completing it. 

5. Threadpool is a class that optimizes how threads get pushed to do tasks in an algorithm. 

6. The parameter is an action delegate. 

7. Using the thread name "threadname" it would be threadname.Start(); 

8. Run() is a method that you use to create and run a task at the same time. 

9. Independent tasks are confusing and changes to the program might change the order that tasks are run. Parallel ensures that 
two tasks are run at the same time. 

10. Create a CancellationTokenSource object and a CancellationToken object. Set the CancellationToken equal to the 
CancellationTokenSource object.Token. Run the task and if the condition is met that you want to cancel run the command 
CancellationTokenSource object.Cancel();
